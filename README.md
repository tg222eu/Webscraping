Personal note

Setup IDE with pycharm

Check if git is installed through terminal. Write "git". If you get an error then you need to install git https://git-scm.com/ and restart pycharm

Integrate git with pycharm. In the toolbar under VCS, go to "Enable Version Control Integration", select Git. Now the project folder files will change color and that means it successfully integrated

Configure pycharms default browser: Press ctrl + alt + S, under Tools -> Web Browser and Preview, in Default Browser change it to "First listed" so chrome will be selected

In File -> settings -> version control -> Github add your github account, then clone a repository
